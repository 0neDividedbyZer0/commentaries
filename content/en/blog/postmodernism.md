I have a lot of friends who work in STEM fields who are perplexed by my stance against "theory."
Theory after all seems like an all important innovation on par with the Scientific Method itself. 
Some might argue that science **is** theory.

One large source of confusion here is what I and many social scientists mean by "theory."
While most natural scientists stringently use the term theory to mean either a model or an all encompassing theory in their field, the latter is usually called a **grand theory** for social scientists. Examples of social grand theories include Marxism, Anarchism, Liberalism, Fascism, etc.
A model on the other hand is different in scale. It's effectively a theory as well, but it is smaller and its truth is in doubt. There's a deliberate reductionism in models that allow it to be superceded by better models or modelling choices. Social science usually calls models **middle theories.** And middle theories/models are heavily used in social science. 

So when I say I am against "theory," it means I am against grand theories **in social science.** This is a crucial difference between natural sciences and social sciences. Natural sciences have a totalizing, universal truth that applies anywhere, anytime. There is no *assumption* for social sciences.[^1]

## But Why?
A lot of people love Jared Diamond, but across Anthropology and especially History, he's hated.[^2]
It makes sense that many of us would assume there's a grand theory of mankind out there. After all, we all need food and water and fun and shelter and social lives and avoid pain or death, and many of these basic tenets cross cultural boundaries. Why then is there no *assumed* grand theory?

For a time, there were *assumed* grand theories. Marxism is one of the most famous, as was Social Darwinism. **Modernism** can be defined as a belief in social grand theories, and we were in the modernist era until relatively recently. 

One of the biggest reasons we have moved away from grand theories is because thus far, none of the useful ones have held true once you consider unignorable exceptions, and of the ones that are true, these are so useless they are basically unhelpful. For example, Social Darwinism isn't true. It's an argument premised on racism and views societal or economic success based on one's fitness, a very vague notion that basically meant you were white and born rich. Social Darwinism is premised on the idea that life and history is competition, but there's piles of evidence saying otherwise: we're born social animals, we have families that are premised on cooperation and raise us (supposedly) cooperatively, and - the smoking gun - competition breeds cooperation.[^3]

Or take Marxism. Marxism tells history as a story of class struggle, that different groups of varying economic backgrounds struggle to obtain their best 

(just-so/determinism/probability argument, social constructivism/science is less strict than you think, postmodernism, middle theory/modeling, statistics: all models are wrong, some models are useful, type X error, lack of other perspectives becomes stale and rigid)

[^1]: There are maybe two fields where this is an exception: economics and political science. These social sciences are deliberately reductionist and are still trying to achieve grand theories. Economics for example has macroeconomic models such as the [RBC or DSGE models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium), and political science has [IR theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations_theory). However, recently, greater interdisciplinary work, non-Eurocentrism, and disasters such as the 2008 economic crisis has pushed these fields more and more towards ditching grand theories.

[^3]: If one actually takes competition to its natural conclusion, it turns out cooperation is the best strategy. Social organisms are on average healthier than solitary and nonsocial organisms. The classic book on this is *Mutual Aid* by Pyotr Kropotkin.
