Hi

## Styles

What you see here is the base reset CSS plus the Zen styles. I fully expect most users of this theme will remove the Zen styles. They are a set of styles I happen to often use in my own projects.

To make this theme look like anything you need to add your own custom styling to it. It is a **base** theme after all.
