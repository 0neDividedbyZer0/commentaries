### Eclectic:
 Having an amalgam of several ideas, not necessarily with overarching consistency.

 ##### Simple:
  I believe a lot of shit, and all of that shit doesn't get along all the time.

### Leftist:
Left leaning on the political spectrum. People don't really have an understanding of what makes something politically left or right due to poor definitions, but I generally like the definition of left as in favor of equality and right in favor of hierarchy. This definition is consistent with these definitions during the French Revolution, which is where we got our modern terminology from, and with the three branches of socialism (in order of least left to most left: democratic socialist, communist, anarchist).

##### Simple:
 I believe in equality
