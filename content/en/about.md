This website provides sources and relevant political and social theories to deal with our current crises.

We live in a time of rising economic, racial, and gender inequality, and at risk is ecological catastrophe and the return of fascism. Yet there appear to be few paths out of our problems, despite history showing otherwise.

This website will give my commentaries on these ideas, and importantly provide context and history around them for a fairer consideration of their applicability or significance. There will also be discussions on topics I think are interesting.

## About Me

I have historical training and knowledge of anthropology and sociology, but not a degree in those areas. Consider me an enthusiast or independent researcher, but I hope this non-academic perspective can provide a refreshing look at problems, topics, and ideas that are often left unsaid or unconsidered, though their effects are felt.
