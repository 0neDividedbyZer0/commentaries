This website is intended to be a source of info about relevant political and social theories to deal with our current political and social crises.

We live in a time of rising economic, racial, and gender inequality, where the foundations of society are being questioned, and at risk is ecological catastrophe and the return of fascism. 

It seems like there are no alternatives in the United States besides liberalism and conservatism, despite history being otherwise, so let's change that. 

This website will give my own commentaries and understandings of these texts and trying to contextualize and historicize them for greater consideration of their relevance. It will also present additional information on topics I think are of interest.

## About Me

I am a Chinese American who reads a lot and has training as a historian with relevant knowledge of anthropology and sociology. I also have a degree in computer science and math, specializing in AI and data science.

This unique combination gives me a lot of interdisciplinary breadth which helps bring together ideas across fields, especially for history. Historians are supposed to read broadly and learn all they can in preparation for their discipline. So as not to waste this knowledge, I hope to present the ideas I have learned here.

My specialization in history is concentrated mostly in Chinese history (in other words, I know the primary sources in this area).
