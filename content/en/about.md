This website provides sources and relevant political and social theories to deal with our current crises.

We live in a time of rising economic, racial, and gender inequality, where the foundations of society are being questioned, and at risk is ecological catastrophe and the return of fascism. 

It seems like there are no alternatives in the United States besides liberalism and conservatism, despite history being otherwise, so let's change that. 

This website will give my own commentaries and understandings of these texts and trying to contextualize and historicize them for greater consideration of their relevance. It will also present additional information on topics I think are of interest.

## About Me

I am a Chinese American who has training as a historian with relevant knowledge of anthropology and sociology. I also have a degree in computer science and math.

My background gives me interdisciplinary breadth and allows me to bring together ideas across fields, especially for history. To not waste my history knowledge, I hope to present the ideas I have learned here.
