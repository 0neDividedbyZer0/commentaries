This website provides sources and relevant political and social theories to deal with our current crises.

We live in a time of rising economic, racial, and gender inequality, and at risk is ecological catastrophe and the return of fascism. Yet there appear to be few paths out of our problems, despite history saying otherwise.

This website will give my commentaries on these ideas, and it will contextualize and historicize them. There will also be discussions on topics I think are interesting.

## About Me

I am a Chinese American who has historical training and knowledge of anthropology and sociology. I also have a degree in computer science and math.

My interdisciplinary background allows me to bring together ideas spread across fields, especially for history. Rather than waste that knowledge, I will present them here.
